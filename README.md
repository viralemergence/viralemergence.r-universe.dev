# viralemergence.r-universe.dev
R universe instance for the Verena Institute.

 https://github.com/r-universe/viralemergence

The R universe is a fully searchable database of R packages as well as a repository that you can install packages from.
Our R universe instance 1) makes it easier to find our packages, 2) provides pre-built versions of packages for most operating systems, and 3) provides a landing page for packages that is informative for users and authors.  

See [R Universe] Docuementation for more information. 

## What to contribute

This R universe instance is meant to capture [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) developed by people at Verena. 

Check out the search engine optimzation section in the [R Universe docs](https://docs.r-universe.dev/publish/metadata.html) for suggestions on how to increase findability for your package. 

## How to contribute

All repositories containing R packages listed in our `packages.json` file will be published to our R Universe instance.
To add a package to `packages.json` either open an issue, open a pull request from a branch with the modified `packages.json` file, or directly modify the file.
